# What is Programming?

Computers do not understnds what humans speak.
The Computer understands only Binary language i.e. in the form of 0’s &1’s.
To communicate with computers, we need a program. 


# Program:

A set of instructions given to a computer by the user to perform certain tasks.
To communicate with the Computer the humans required a PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.

Programming is simply giving computers a set of instructions to complete a task using a programming language. In our day to day life, we depend on programming languages. 


For example:

When a person (for suppose, Jane) is buying groceries, there was a program that could take the input received from the barcode scanner and convert it to a price for each item. The cash register program instructed the printer to take these prices and print them out together with some other calculations. When Jane was paying with the credit card, the point of sale machine contacted another program somewhere else. This program took care of all the bank processing and updated the balance on Jane's account. 



# What is Programming language?

A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.
A programming language is a bridge that facilitates communication b/w computers & people.



# How we can use a Programming language in our local system?

For a computer to understand a programming language, it needs to save it somewhere in its random access memory (RAM) or on a disk in binary code, which is represented by a series of zeros and ones. The binary code is a representation of machine language. That a computer can understand all of the zeros and ones in binary language represent electrical switches. Finally, a computer's central processing unit, or CPU can comprehend these binary electrical signals and update itself accordingly. This machine language, with its series of zeros and ones, is known as a low level language because it's closer to being understood by a computer's CPU.

There are also high level languages such as JavaScript, that needs to be interpreted, that is converted to binary code that a CPU will be able to work with. So we might think of JavaScript and other high level languages as a tool that helps us to communicate with the CPU. 



# PROGRAMMING WITH JAVASCRIPT:

So-much of what you take for granted in your everyday online life, like using:
A Search Engine (browser),
Online Shopping, and
Using social media is made possible by JavaScript. 


Nearly all of the interactivity you experience online, like drop-down menus or the autocomplete function, is facilitated by JavaScript. 




# HOW IS JAVASCRIPT USED IN REAL WORLD?

Anytime you're using a browser, anytime you're browsing the Internet, you are using JavaScript. It's the language of the Internet.
JavaScript is actually something that maybe your coffee maker had some JavaScript, your car might have JavaScript.
Nowadays, we are in a world where JavaScript is so common and so used across a lot of technologies and a lot of devices that it's become a language that cannot be replaced.
Now, we see the world runs using JavaScript and just about every application we interact with today probably has some JavaScript in it, one way or another. 


# WHY TO CHOOSE JAVASCRIPT?

In the last few hours or maybe even in the last few minutes, you've probably interacted with web pages to do things like watch videos, look for locations on maps, or interact with your social media feeds, and even now also we are interacting with GIT.

# But what makes this interactivity possible? 
But what makes this interactivity possible i.e. The programming language JavaScript. 


# So what is it that makes JavaScript so integral to modern browsers? 

JavaScript is currently the only computer language that allows us to directly interact with our web pages dynamically on the client. It's baked into the browser. 
Its enduring popularity is down to the rules of backwards compatibility, which states that all websites that were built in the past still need to work today. 
So removing JavaScript from the browser would effectively render millions of websites completely useless. This means that JavaScript is in the unique position of being one of several central pillars of web development. 
Also, JavaScript's unique ecosystem is one of the main reasons for its popularity. Simply put, browsers speak JavaScript.



For example: 

in the early 2000s, different companies built Internet browsers and were referred to as browser vendors. However, with different browsers came different behaviors with various discrepancies between other browsers. This resulted in developers sometimes having to write separate JavaScript code for different browsers. This wasn't the best use of developer time and could lead to a frustrating experience for end-users. Out of this frustration, several projects appeared trying to solve this compatibility problem. One such project managed to solve these issues and it was a library named jQuery. 

Using the jQuery library, all a developer needed was to import jQuery and write code using its features. This code would then work across all browsers. At the time, it was like magic, as it was such a great solution to the problem of incompatibility and jQuery became the most popular JavaScript library for well over a decade. 

However, as the web and the way we code kept evolving, new problems appeared, and soon enough, new solutions to those problems needed to be built. Once such a solution was React, which came out in 2011 and it had a considerable effect on the way we think about websites and how we build them. React, solved many of the issues associated with creating, updating and maintaining complex websites. Soon, many other technologies appeared attempting to do the same. These include Knockout, Backbone, Angular, Ember, Vue, Alpine, and others. With millions of websites containing JavaScript code from different versions and libraries, there is a lot of old code. This is known as a legacy code. While you probably won't use jQuery to build a modern website today, you might still come across it in a project that is still actively running. 


# WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT?

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a lightweight, cross platform, object-oriented programming language as Well as client-side scripting language.



JavaScript is most well-known for being the programming language of the web. But it has become so much more. Now, it is used not only for the front-end development, but also for back-end development, and you can even create mobile apps using JavaScript and React. JS is the browser’s language. The browser will execute the JS’s code. JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage. We might have seen sliders, alerts, click interactions, pop ups, etc. on different websites, all of that is built using JavaScript. Apart from being used in the browser, it is also used in other non-browser environments as well such as Node.js for writing server-side code in JavaScript, Electron for writing desktop applications, React Native for mobile applications, and so on.



# Role of Interpreter:

Scripting languages use the interpreter to executes the code line by line. 
JavaScript, is an interpreted language as it uses an interpreter, not a compiled language.
It uses the browser to run the code. 
More modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.
JavaScript has no compilation steps but JS code is compiled by a JIT (Just in time) compiler which converts the JS code to byte code.
JavaScript is using an interpreter to convert the byte code to machine code hence it is an interpreted language.
