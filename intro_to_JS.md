# What is Programming?

Computers do not understnds what humans speak. 
The Computer understands only Binary language i.e. in the form of 0’s &1’s
To communicate with computers, we need a program.
 

Program:

A set of instructions given to a computer by the user to perform certain tasks.
To communicate with the Computer the humans required a PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.

A series of instructions that tell a computer what to do in specific circumstances.
They are written to perform a specific set of tasks. 
To program these instructions, we use programming languages. 




Programming is simply giving computers a set of instructions to complete a task using a programming language. In our day to day life, we depend on programming languages. 




For example, 


When a person (Jane) is buying groceries, there was a program that could take the input received from the barcode scanner and convert it to a price for each item. The cash register program instructed the printer to take these prices and print them out together with some other calculations. When Jane was paying with the credit card, the point of sale machine contacted another program somewhere else. This program took care of all the bank processing and updated the balance on Jane's account. 


Yet more programs were involved in her smartwatch tracking her heartbeats. 


For Jane to be able to order flowers for a friend, a lot of other programs on many different machines were involved. These might include satellites or some other telecommunication computer programs.


Computer programs are everywhere. All these programs are called software and are in one way or another, and running on physical machines which are referred to as hardware. 












Programming language


A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.
A programming language is a bridge that facilitates communication b/w computers & people.

It is a set of Symbols, grammar & rules with the help of which one is able to translate algorithms to programs that will be executed by the computer.

The description of Programming Language is usually split into 2 types:

Syntax i.e.; form
Semantics i.e. meaning



For a computer to understand a programming language, it needs to save it somewhere in its random access memory. RAM or on a disk in binary code, which is represented by a series of zeros and ones. 
The binary code is a representation of machine language. That a computer can understand all of the zeros and ones in binary language represent electrical switches. 
Finally, a computer's central processing unit, or CPU can comprehend these binary electrical signals and update itself accordingly. 
This machine language, with its series of zeros and ones, is known as a low level language because it's closer to being understood by a computer's CPU.


There are also high level languages such as JavaScript, that needs to be interpreted, that is converted to binary code that a CPU will be able to work with. So we might think of JavaScript and other high level languages as a tool that helps us to communicate with the CPU. 




PROGRAMMING WITH JAVASCRIPT

So-much of what you take for granted in your everyday online life, like using:

A Search Engine (browser), 
Shopping, and 
Using social media is made possible by JavaScript. 








Nearly all of the interactivity you experience online, like drop-down menus or the autocomplete function, is facilitated by JavaScript.

HOW IS JAVASCRIPT USED IN REAL WORLD?

Anytime you're using a browser, anytime you're browsing the Internet, you are using JavaScript. It's the language of the Internet.

JavaScript is actually something that as you're watching someone through the video, maybe your coffee maker had some JavaScript, your car might have JavaScript.

Nowadays, we are in a world where JavaScript is so common and so used across a lot of technologies and a lot of devices that it's become a language that cannot be replaced.

Now, we see the world runs using JavaScript and just about every application we interact with today probably has some JavaScript in it, one way or another. 


WHY JAVASCRIPT


In the last few hours or maybe even in the last few minutes, you've probably interacted with web pages to do things like watch videos, look for locations on maps, or interact with your social media feeds. 


But what makes this interactivity possible? i.e. The programming language JavaScript. 


JavaScript is a language that builds interactivity into web pages. It is literally the language of the web. Almost every website runs JavaScript in some form or another. 


The reason for this is the fact that since its very inception In 1995, JavaScript has been the main way to interact with web pages on the client side, the front end side of websites and web applications. 


Using JavaScript, updates are displayed in real time on our devices. Some common examples include interactive maps and client side form validation. 


Over the years, there have been some alternatives to JavaScript, such as VBScript and more recently TypeScript. But even typescript compiles down to JavaScript so browsers can understand it. 


Since JavaScript is one of the most widely available and frequently used methods for interacting with the browser on the client side, the language became immensely popular. 
In fact, developer surveys often show that JavaScript remains one of the most popular programming languages today. 


So what is it that makes JavaScript so integral to modern browsers? 


JavaScript is currently the only computer language that allows us to directly interact with our web pages dynamically on the client. It's baked into the browser. 


Its enduring popularity is down to the rules of backwards compatibility, which states that all websites that were built in the past still need to work today. 


So removing JavaScript from the browser would effectively render millions of websites completely useless. This means that JavaScript is in the unique position of being one of several central pillars of web development. 


JavaScript's unique ecosystem is one of the main reasons for its popularity. Simply put, browsers speak JavaScript. But there are a few other important reasons why we should embrace JavaScript. 




Ease-of-use:


One of the main reasons that developers use JavaScript is because of how easy it is to use. There are many programming languages where a newcomer needs to do a substantial amount of prep work to even get set up and ready to learn. In the case of JS, with a browser & it’s built in tools, we can step into learning.




Built-in-tools: 


However, with JavaScript it's as simple as opening the browser's developer tools and navigating to the console tab because every browser has a JavaScript engine built in and you can interact with it using the console. 




Used widely:


Another reason to learn and use JavaScript is because it's everywhere. JavaScript is used in almost every website there is. It's used on the client side of sites as plain JavaScript also known as vanilla JavaScript. It fuels a myriad of JavaScript frameworks such as React, Vue, and D3 and it's also used on the server as Node.js and more recently Deno. 




Development community


Another reason why people often choose JavaScript is that it's considered one of the more accessible programming languages. It also has a wide development community to offer help and guidance. This is especially true when it's compared to other languages. There are many languages that for a variety of reasons would be very challenging to begin programming with. But because it's so approachable, JavaScript can be a great way for new developers to jump into programming. 






Huge demand


Finally, one more reason to learn JavaScript is because JavaScript skills are in demand. Countless job postings appear for JavaScript developers every day and these will keep coming for the foreseeable future. 


So, JS is the foundation of technology for everything you do online with a huge variety of uses. Plus it's easy to get started with and once you're up and running there's lots of job offers and projects open to you. 




HISTORY OF JS

⮚ The mid-1990s was a crucial time for the internet. 

⮚ Netscape and Microsoft were in the midst of browser wars, with Netscape's Navigator and Microsoft's Internet Explorer going head to head. 

⮚ During early 1995, Netscape (co-founded by Marc Andreessen) was overgrowing to nearly 80% of the browser market share, but web designers needed a language to make their sites more dynamic. In the beginning they turned to Java but realized that they need more dynamic and approachable language. 

⮚ During May 1995, Brendan Eich was recruited by Netscape to put "Scheme in the browser", but was under pressure to produce a prototype quickly with the threat of Microsoft beating them to the punch. 

⮚ In September 1995, a Netscape programmer named Brandan Eich developed a new scripting language in just ten days, which was called Mocha. 

⮚ Due to marketing reasons, Mocha was renamed to LiveScript in the year 1995(September).

⮚ But during 1995 Java was a famous programming language, So to gather the developer's attention, again LiveScript was renamed to JavaScript in the year 1995(December). 

⮚ In 1997, due to JavaScript's rapid growth, it became clear that the language would need to be appropriately maintained and managed. Therefore, Netscape handed the job of creating a language specification to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA), a body founded to standardize computing. 

⮚ In the year 1997(June) the first standardized version of JavaScript (ES1) was approved by the TC-39 committee as ECMA-262 or ECMAScript. It has many of the features we use in JS today, like first-class functions, objects, and prototypal inheritance. 

⮚ In the year 1998(June), the second version of JavaScript ES2 is standardized, mostly unchanged. 

⮚ In December 1999, ES3 was standardized, adding support for strict equality, exception handling, and more. 

⮚ The tech bubble bursts in March 2000. 

⮚ The TC-39 committee decides to develop ECMAScript 3.1 (the simple version) and ECMAScript 4 (the enterprise version) in parallel. Ultimately, this approach fails, and ES4 never sees the light of day. 

⮚ In December 2009, exactly ten years after ES3 the new version of JavaScript - ES5 was introduced, which adds a conservative set of new features based on ES3.1 like strict mode, accessors, and JSON. 

⮚ During 2015, ES6/ES2015 brings a ton of new features to the language (many of which originated in the failed ES4), such as let/const, arrow functions, classes, promises, and more. It gives rise to transpilers like Babel and Typescript, so developers can write modern code, but still support legacy browsers that run ES5/3. 

⮚ ES6 can also be called as ES2015 ,in 2015 Annual release cycle was changed. Instead of shipping a new version with lots of updated features every couple of years,A new version has to released in every year with just few features per year

⮚ During 2016, through ES7/ES2016, we got minor changes, like Array.includes(). 

Most importantly, ECMA is now making small changes on an annual basis. 

⮚ In the year 2017, Async Await was introduced in ES8/ES2017. 

⮚ In the year 2018, Rest/Spread syntax was introduced in ES9/ES2018. 

⮚ During 2019, ES10/ES2019 was released with useful updates which have been finalized.
At present, ECMA2023 / ECMA14 is the new release in 2023.
For example, in the early 2000s, different companies built Internet browsers and were referred to as browser vendors. 

However, with different browsers came different behaviors with various discrepancies between other browsers. This resulted in developers sometimes having to write separate JavaScript code for different browsers. 




This wasn't the best use of developer time and could lead to a frustrating experience for end-users. Out of this frustration, several projects appeared trying to solve this compatibility problem. One such project managed to solve these issues and it was a library named jQuery. 



Using the jQuery library, all a developer needed was to import jQuery and write code using its features. This code would then work across all browsers. At the time, it was like magic, as it was such a great solution to the problem of incompatibility and jQuery became the most popular JavaScript library for well over a decade. 

However, as the web and the way we code kept evolving, new problems appeared, and soon enough, new solutions to those problems needed to be built. Once such a solution was React, which came out in 2011 and it had a considerable effect on the way we think about websites and how we build them. React, solved many of the issues associated with creating, updating and maintaining complex websites. Soon, many other technologies appeared attempting to do the same. These include Knockout, Backbone, Angular, Ember, Vue, Alpine, and others. With millions of websites containing JavaScript code from different versions and libraries, there is a lot of old code. This is known as a legacy code. While you probably won't use jQuery to build a modern website today, you might still come across it in a project that is still actively running. 

But don't worry, sometimes beginners think they have to learn or even master all the different technologies associated with JavaScript. However, that's not really necessary. To be a well-rounded developer, you need to learn and master the basics of plain JavaScript without the frameworks. Once you have this foundation, the pathway will become easier for you to learn a framework built on top of JavaScript, such as React. 

VERSIONS OF JS


When it comes to Front End, there are three core technologies as follows:
 
HTML	⇒ To Create the structure of a web page or web site.
CSS    	⇒ To Style the web page or web site.
JS       	⇒ To add functionality / dynamic nature / interactivity to the static web page or web site that is built using HTML & CSS.

WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a lightweight, cross platform, object-oriented programming language as Well as client-side scripting language.

JavaScript is most well-known for being the programming language of the web. But it has become so much more. 

Now, it is used not only for the front-end development, but also for back-end development, and you can even create mobile apps using JavaScript and React. 
 
JS is the browser’s language. The browser will execute the JS’s code.
 
JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage.

We might have seen sliders, alerts, click interactions, pop ups, etc. on different websites, all of that is built using JavaScript. 

Apart from being used in the browser, it is also used in other non-browser environments as well such as Node.js for writing server-side code in JavaScript, Electron for writing desktop applications, React Native for mobile applications, and so on.



JS	⇒	 Used for both front end & backend development, and the creation of mobile applications.
